== CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION 10/04/2012 ==

To run an instance, just:

$ cd omniscientAA
$ python minimumOmniscientAA.py

and open a Pidgin, Finch or make a nullclient.

Any IM network in which the pidgin/finch/nullclient
is connected will receive messages as shouts.

This code and generalSender.py should be integrated to
the code ASAP.
