What is AA? What is the point of AA?
====================================

Check out this actual IRC conversation for a direct explanation of what AA
currently is (as of early 2012), in the vision of v1z. However, keep in mind
that AA is much deeper than that, and is the great vision of the mighty o0o0o.


16:20 < hybrid> for AA is the core of LabMacambira.sf.net
16:21 -!- hybrid is now known as o0o0o
16:21 < v1z_> pizte: take hybrid very seriously when he says that ;)
16:22 < pizte> I'm looking it
16:22 < v1z_> he's right and proven himself all the more so through time !!
16:23 < pizte> I'm sorry I still don't get the point of AA. So, while I'm coding I keep texting on AA during 2h a day?
16:24 < pizte> don't take it wrong, I think it's a great idea, but I don't see the objective :)
16:24 < pizte> s/don't/can't
16:24 < o0o0o> pizte its totally cool not to get the point. LabMacambira members take a long time to get it also
16:25 < o0o0o> yeah, there are some different approaches for using AA
16:25 < pizte> o0o0o: you're here! sorry the other day I didn't answer you! :/
16:25 < o0o0o> (most of the time here, we care for 'despersonification')
16:26 < pizte> o0o0o: sorry, got confused hehe
********************
16:26 < v1z_> pizte: let me try to explain AA in my computer nerd terms
16:26 < v1z_> so its basically a social way to coordinate development among distributed teams
16:27 < v1z_> nowadays we work on teams (like labmacambira) which are not in the same physical space
16:27 < v1z_> and there are no bosses.
16:27 < v1z_> its decentralized
16:27 < v1z_> and distributed.
16:27 < v1z_> AA is a methodology for dealing with that
16:27 < v1z_> the core idea is really simple
16:27 < v1z_> for selected 2h/day, you use microblogging to publish what you're doing
16:28 < v1z_> every 15min
16:28 < v1z_> then at the end you record a videolog.
16:28 < v1z_> that habit, taken seriously, will contribute to a social mechanism
16:28 < v1z_> that will increase productivity
16:28 < v1z_> of the team
16:28 < v1z_> the microbloggin is not for "the boss" -> there aint one
16:28 < v1z_> the microblogging is for the team
16:29 < v1z_> or at least for work groups within the team...
16:29 < humannoise> nerd ways are, computationally nerd ways are soo algorithimic :D
16:29 < humannoise> i mean organized
16:29 < v1z_> so, its just a way of leveraging the power of social mechanisms
16:29 < v1z_> and social networks
16:30 < v1z_> to coordinate work.
16:30 < v1z_> the microblog feeds and videlog feeds are all public
16:30 < v1z_> perhaps using pseudonyms/nicks for des-personification
16:30 < v1z_> like o0o0o loves 
16:30 < v1z_> that way people feel more at ease to publish their activity to peers
16:31 < pizte> ok, I get it, but does it really increase productivity? Because in that case it works based on suggestive content like: "He did that, I ave to do something"
16:31 < v1z_> this worked in practice over the 2nd. semester of 2011
16:31 < pizte> *have
16:31 < v1z_> we coordinated a team of 15 with this, last semester.
16:31 < v1z_> pizte: well if there was a boss, kind of.
16:31 < v1z_> if the team just wants to get something done..
16:32 < v1z_> and if you use AA with a good ethical/social attitude
16:32 < v1z_> it has shown to work very well.
16:32 < v1z_> people do periodical reviews -> its all in the logs
16:32 < v1z_> when a client asks for a report
16:32 < v1z_> you point them to the logs
16:32 < v1z_> it saves bureaucracy...
16:32 < v1z_> and it has more colors to it... I just described the raw stuff
16:33 < pizte> now I really get it... it's pretty well thought
16:33 < o0o0o> pizte the point in AA is sharing your hacking experience so people can do things together. AA works as we used and use it. Besides that, that opens legal doors for sustaining us as it documents our dedications also
16:33 < v1z_> like, last semester, my workgroup had 3 other programmers
16:33 < v1z_> when I met them physically, great.
16:34 < v1z_> then when I traveled, the logs and videologs *really* made the whole difference
16:34 < v1z_> in the teamwork
16:34 < v1z_> in keeping up with them
16:34 < v1z_> in minimizing superfluous meetings.
16:34 < o0o0o> those legal doors are side effects we are enjoying allot
16:34 < v1z_> and periodically, at my leisure, I could also check what the rest of the big 15-person team was doing
16:35 < v1z_> socially tight-knit stuff
16:35 < v1z_> the 2h thing -> its totally arbitrary.
16:35 < v1z_> it has worked well for part-time team members
16:36 < v1z_> to work like a day, but take these 2h aside for the microblogged + videlogged activity
16:36 < v1z_> the rest of the time is free
16:36 < v1z_> they can microblog freestyle
16:36 < v1z_> or not...
16:36 < v1z_> also, mentors microblog freestyle always. they don't have to do the 2h thing
16:36 < o0o0o> 15/min is also arbitrary
16:36 < pizte> great
16:37 < v1z_> but they're motivated and tend to naturally microblog and create longer screencasts
16:37 < v1z_> thats basically my way of seeing it... but o0o0o's view goes deep ;-)
16:38 < o0o0o> v1z_, thanks
16:38 < genjix> v1z_: interesting. what about just skype calls?
16:38 < v1z_> finally, about the sustainement aspect
16:38 < v1z_> (just a sec)
16:38 < genjix> generally i'm against enforced meetings and tasks
16:38 < v1z_> the whole self-documentation of the methodology
16:38 < pizte> o0o0o: can you give a link to take a look to AA? or do I have to install an instance on a server?
16:38 < v1z_> in addition to eliminating most need for reports 
16:39 < v1z_> and most need for meetings
16:39 < o0o0o> pizte just install and run the client side of it
16:39 < v1z_> they also *validate* the programming activity
16:39 < genjix> reports?
16:39 < o0o0o> if u need help/links etc, we are here
16:39 < v1z_> meaning, people tend to fund more
16:39 < genjix> what's wrong with just a skype call when there's a problem?
16:39 < pizte> o0o0o: yeah, can you give me some link related to the AA client installation?
16:39 < v1z_> because they know more or less whats being done
16:39 < v1z_> (without getting too strict)
16:39 < v1z_> but at least they know
16:40 < genjix> i was thinking of having daily 15 min standup meetings among our group
16:40 < o0o0o> pizte http://wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br/GSoC#AA_.28client.29
16:40 < lalenia> <http://ln-s.net/9wV1> (at wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br)
16:40 < v1z_> genjix: that's not documented
16:40 < v1z_> its not effective
16:40 < v1z_> its not asyncrhonous
16:41 < genjix> but they were unpopular and i eventually saw it was a waste of time
16:41 < v1z_> syncrhonous meetings suck
16:41 < v1z_> you want people doing their stuff their own time most of the time
16:41 < v1z_> as much as possible
16:41 < v1z_> if you want to catch up, you don't need their attention
16:41 < v1z_> just read their log and get going
16:41 < genjix> oh that's an interesting idea
16:41 < genjix> i never thought of looking at things from that angle
16:42 < genjix> very interesting
16:42 < o0o0o> genjix, AA is not for 'when there is a problem' it is for 'doing things together'
16:42 < o0o0o> _o_o_ oOo _o_o_
16:42 < genjix> because sometimes i go online and ask my friend "hey what's up. what you been working on"
16:42 < v1z_> genjix: its ever more important for very  distributed teams
16:42 < o0o0o> very happy u both got it, this is quite difficult to share
16:42 < o0o0o> v1z_,  congrats
16:42 < v1z_> imagine meeting with irish+indian+brazilian devs through skype
16:42 < genjix> what is AA?
16:42 < v1z_> on a regular basis...
16:43 < genjix> AA = ?
16:43 < v1z_> AA = algorithm autoregulation
16:43 < v1z_> (of teams)
16:43 < v1z_> algorithmic
16:43 < v1z_> sorry
16:43 < v1z_> it is a broad methodology for coordinating
16:43 < v1z_> distributed and decentralized teamwork
16:43 < genjix> aha ok
16:44 < v1z_> in its current form, it is: *read above*
16:44 < v1z_> ;-)
16:44 < v1z_> o0o0o: calls AA the Ambiguous Acronym
16:44 < v1z_> and then you get off to the crazy tangent that AA dominates the world..
16:44 < v1z_> and thats why our very logo is (AA)
16:44 < v1z_> (the end)
16:45 < v1z_> o0o0o is doing his msc thesis on this (to a good extent)
16:45 < v1z_> and we should publish a paper on it
16:45 < v1z_> of course detailing all ramifications and colors that I havent described.
16:46 < genjix> https://intersango.com/orderbook.php?currency_pair_id=3&debug=true
16:46 < o0o0o> v1z_, actually my msc is on using code for music
16:46 < lalenia> <http://ln-s.net/9xSb> (at intersango.com)
16:46 < v1z_> o0o0o: ok
16:46 < v1z_> ;)
16:47 < v1z_> but I'll write the paper anyways
16:47 < v1z_> so we materialize a more complete thing
16:47 < v1z_> (we'll)
